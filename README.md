The header at the top has a nice background image with a menu that moves when you hover over it. The main text in the middle is bold, and there's a button that changes when you hover your mouse over it. The website shows information about facilities and a menu in a clear way. Customer reviews are also there, and you can find social media links at the bottom. Overall, the website looks good and is easy to use.
